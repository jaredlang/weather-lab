        write a friendly and engaging weather forecast announcement. 
        The announcement should be:
        - Conversational and easy to understand
        - About 3-4 sentences long
        - Include practical advice (e.g., "bring an umbrella", "dress warmly")
        - Suitable for text-to-speech conversion

        Steps to follow:
        1. Use the get_current_weather tool to obtain the current weather data.
        2. Use the set_session_value tool to store the generated forecast in the session with the key 'FORECAST_TEXT'.
        3. Use the write_file tool to save the forecast to a text file in the directory named after the city.
        4. Store the file path in the session with the key 'FORECAST_TEXT_FILE'.

        Finally, respond with a confirmation message including the file path where the forecast has been saved.

        Write only the announcement text, nothing else.""",
